# Abstract

This research was a collaboration between psychology and biology faculty to investigate the impact of a semester-long active learning assignment on 1) improvement in ability to read technical literature, ability to interpret data presented in figures, understand core course concepts and 2) changes in attitudes toward science. The project, a student-generated case study, involved finding an empirical article in the related field (cell biology), locating a "data figure" in article that summarized the results of part of the research (using the information in the article), interpreting and summarizing the results presented in the data figure, writing an MCAT style passage related to the data figure, developing a clear figure caption for the data figure and constructing 5 MCAT-style multiple-choice questions.

# Background

Evidence-based best educational practices support a pedagogical model that is student learning-centered and involves considerable active learning approaches (Freeman et al., 2014; Nilson, 2016). Future success in STEM careers is more likely if students have mastered core principles in foundational fields (“core science”), and have developed strong reading, critical thinking, problem-solving, deductive reasoning, data analysis and communication skills (“research-critical” skills). In agreement with the importance of a core science, research-critical skillset as a predictor of future student success, many pre-professional standardized tests (e.g., MCAT and GRE) require students to analyze passages. In these passages, a relatively short narrative is accompanied by a data figure with some questions requiring analysis and interpretation of data and others testing mastery of core principles. Students often report being underprepared for the rigors of passage-based exams. A pedagogical approach that provides systematic and progressive development of self-directed learning, core science and research-critical skills is needed. We hypothesize that having students develop and write their own experimental passage is a powerful approach to improve student aptitudes and attitudes in core science and research-critical areas. 

# Methods

Student volunteers across three semesters (FA 18 – FA 19) completed the student-generated case study project in multiple stages including: the submission of an empirical article with identification of a data figure, a pre-draft of interpretation of information related to a figure, a rough draft of a narrative passage and questions and a final draft. The scoring of these assignments changed over the three semesters that the study was run. Initially, the pre-draft and rough draft were graded by completion of, not success in, each criterion (see Figure 1). In the last semester, the instructor graded the pre-draft and rough draft using both a "mastery" orientation and an "effort" orientation. Whereas the scores from the "mastery" orientation were used for research purposes to assess growth, the "effort" orientation scores were used to scaffold students toward the final draft.

Students were also assessed longitudinally on perceptions of and mastery of project and course content. The pre- and post- measures consisted of attitudes related to field of study (using the BIO-Class assessment; Semsar, Knight, Birol & Smith, 2011) and research-critical skills. The BIO-Class assesses student attitudes in seven domains: 

- Enjoyment (Personal Interest)
- Real World Connection
- Problem-Solving: Reasoning
- Problem-Solving: Synthesis and Application
- Problem-Solving: Strategies
- Problem-Solving: Effort
- Conceptual Connections/Memorization

The research-related skills assessed as part of a pre-test and post-test (final) for the course included:

- Mastery of core course concepts, 
- Technical reading ability,
- Data interpretation / inference, and
- Primary literature component identification.

These research-related skills assessed as composite scales (mean) of correctly answer questions on the test. Example items can be found in Figures 2 through 5.

The longitudinal (with submission of each project stage) assessments were the self-perceptions of one’s:

- Ability to do well on the project,
- Clarity on details of the project,
- Ability to understand the data figure,
- Ability to verbally explain the data figure, and
- Ability to explain the data figure in writing.

The self-perceptions were assessed on 4-point, Likert-type scales (see Table 1)

# Results
All measures were converted to proportion change scores such that positive scores across assignments or tests indicated an improvement in scores whereas a negative score for attitudes reflected moving closer to expert opinion. Students reported significant increases in self-perceptions (*t*s[22] > 2.64, *p*s < .02 <sup>1</sup>; see Figure 6), assignment scores (*t*[56] = 6.57, *p* < .001; see Figure 7), test-scores (*t*s[68] > 4.44, *p*s < .0001; see Figure 8), and significantly closer to expert attitudes on “real world connections” (*t*[65] = 2.43, *p* = 0.017), “problem solving: reasoning” (*t*[65] = 2.49, *p* = 0.015), “problem solving: strategies” (*t*[65] = 4.23, *p* < .001), “problem solving: effort” (*t*[65] = 4.67, p < .001) and “conceptual connections / memorization” (*t*[65] = 3.71, *p* < .001; see Figure 9). It was hypothesized that improvement in assignment scores would be associated with changes in attitude and test scores, but this was not supported. This may be due to changes in grading rubrics across semesters. Interestingly, those whose attitudes more aligned with experts across the semester improved more on measures of primary literature identification (*r*[63] = -0.43, *p* < 0.001), data interpretation (*r*[63] = -0.37, *p* < 0.005), and mastery of course concepts (*r*[63] = -0.46, p < 0.001; See Figure 10).

<sup>1</sup> *t*s refers to multiple t-values (the lowest is reported). *p*s refers to multiple p-values (the highest is reported).

# Discussion

We believe this is a promising approach to improve research-critical skills in many sciences (i.e., chemistry, psychology, etc.). The current study utilized a within-subjects and correlational design to assess growth in research-critical skills. Although there are some benefits to this approach (greater statistical power), it did present some challenges. First, the need to develop two grading systems (one for pedagogy and scaffolding, the other for growth assessment) was learned in the course of this research. Second, the need to update pedagogy across semesters increased variability (perhaps affected the reliability) of our assessments. Third, the within-subjects design only allowed us to see the growth within this approach but did not provide an opportunity to directly compare this method to other (or no) methods.

It is important to state that the impetus for this research originated in feedback students had provided Dr. Formherz after taking the MCAT and pursuing graduate or medical school. Students expressed some negative affect before and during the completion of the student-generated case study but greatly appreciated the benefits after. We suspect that this effect will prove to be even stronger for underprepared students. 

Future researchers interested in this approach should consider an experimental approach by comparing the progress students make with the student-generated case study to other control groups. These control groups may include students taking several practice MCAT/GRE tests throughout the semester, writing literature reviews, or simply reading empirical articles for class preparation.
